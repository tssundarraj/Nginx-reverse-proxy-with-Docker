## 1️⃣ Features
- **FastAPI** backend running in a Docker container.
- **NGINX** as a reverse proxy to serve FastAPI.
- **Docker Compose** for easy deployment and management.
- **Swagger UI** for API documentation and testing.

## 2️⃣ Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Basic knowledge of FastAPI, NGINX, and Docker

## 3️⃣ Why Use a Reverse Proxy?
A **reverse proxy** like NGINX is used in this project to:
- **Improve Security**: Protects the backend by hiding internal infrastructure.
- **Load Balancing**: If multiple FastAPI instances are running, NGINX can distribute traffic.
- **SSL Termination**: Easier to handle HTTPS at the proxy level.
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and compression features can improve response times.
- **Custom Domain Handling**: Allows mapping FastAPI to a friendly domain instead of an IP and port.

## 4️⃣ Problems Solved by a Reverse Proxy
- **Direct Access Prevention**: Without a reverse proxy, the FastAPI service would be directly exposed to users, which is not ideal for security and scalability.
- **Multiple Services Management**: If additional microservices are added in the future, NGINX can route traffic accordingly.
- **Single Entry Point**: Instead of accessing different services with different ports, users access everything through a single domain (e.g., `http://fastapi.local`).
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Offloading static file handling and request routing to NGINX allows FastAPI to focus on processing API requests.

## 5️⃣ Problem Solved by Docker Compose vs Docker
Instead of running separate `docker run` commands, **Docker Compose** simplifies the process by managing multi-container applications with a single configuration file.

## 6️⃣ Project Structure
```

│   ├── main.py
│   ├── Dockerfile
│── nginx/
│   ├── nginx.conf
│── docker-compose.yml
│── README.md
```

## 7️⃣ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-nginx-docker.git
cd fastapi-nginx-docker
```

### Step 2: Create the FastAPI Application
Inside `app/` create `main.py`:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello from FastAPI!"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "query": q}
```

### Step 3: Setup NGINX Reverse Proxy
### Step 4: Create `docker-compose.yml`
### Step 5: Build and Run the Containers
### Step 6: Add Entry in `/etc/hosts`

## 8️⃣ Accessing Swagger UI
FastAPI automatically provides an interactive API documentation using **Swagger UI**.

- Open your browser and visit:
  ```
  http://fastapi.local/docs
  ```
  or
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1/docs
  ```
- This will open the **Swagger UI**, where you can test your API endpoints directly.

For **Redoc UI**, visit:
```
http://fastapi.local/redoc
```

## 9️⃣ Testing the Setup
Open your browser and visit:
```
http://fastapi.local
```
Or use `curl`:
```sh
curl http://fastapi.local
```

## 🔟 Summary
- FastAPI serves the API on port **8000**
- NGINX acts as a reverse proxy on port **80**
- Docker Compose manages both containers
- Swagger UI is accessible at `/docs`

## Next Steps
Now that the basic setup is complete, here are some ideas for expanding this project:
- **Implement Authentication**: Add JWT or OAuth2-based authentication for securing endpoints.
- **Database Integration**: Connect FastAPI to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack to monitor requests and errors.
- **Deploy to the Cloud**: Deploy the setup to AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean.
- **Load Balancing & Scaling**: Run multiple instances of FastAPI and use NGINX for load balancing.
- **Automate Deployment**: Use CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployment.
